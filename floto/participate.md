# Seeking Citizen Science Volunteers to Help Measure the Internet

FLOTO is a research project run by folks at the Internet Equity Initiative at the University of Chicago and at Argonne National Lab. (Read more about the project [here](https://internetequity.org/floto).) The research team is seeking citizen science volunteers to place small measurement devices in households to measure Internet performance. See our [information sheet](../assets/pdfs/FLOTO%20Participation%20Info%20Form.pdf) for more details about the research and what the device does.

## What Does the Device Do?

The device (pictured above) is a specialized tool designed to measure Internet performance at the household level. Think of it as a health monitor for your home Internet service. By connecting to your existing service, the device gathers data on Internet speed, latency, and reliability without impacting your regular usage. These data are anonymous and do not contain any information about your personal usage of the Internet.

## Why Get a Device?

- Contribute to Research: By hosting a device, you will contribute directly to research to improve internet performance in different areas.
- Better Understand Your Connection: The device will help you understand your internet connection's speed and reliability, empowering you with valuable insights.
- Help Improve Internet Connectivity: Your participation will assist in identifying network bottlenecks and issues, leading to improvements in internet connectivity for all.

## Device Hosting Details

- **Minimum Hosting Period**: We request participants to install the device for a minimum of 3 months to collect meaningful data.
- **Compensation**: As a token of appreciation, eligible participants will receive a $50 gift card upon completing the hosting period.
- **Data Privacy**: Rest assured, all data collected from the device is related to your Internet performance. The device will **NOT** collect data on what you do online or how you use the Internet.
- **Publication and Sharing**: The collected data will be published anonymously and shared with our research partners for policy, funding, and research decisions.
