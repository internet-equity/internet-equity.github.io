Bridging the Digital Divide: One Data Point at a Time.

The University of Chicago is seeking citizen science volunteers for a research project ("FLOTO") run by the Internet Equity Initiative and Argonne National Lab. (Read more about the project [here](https://internetequity.org/floto).) Participants will receive a small speed tester to measure their Internet service along with a $50 gift card. Sign up below to receive a measurement device! **See our [information sheet](../assets/pdfs/FLOTO%20Participation%20Info%20Form.pdf) and [FAQs](https://internetequity.org/floto/faqs.html) for more details about the research and what the device does.**

**Skip to [sign up form](#sign-up-now) below.**

## What Does the Speed Tester Do?

The speed tester (pictured above) measures Internet performance at the household level. Think of it as a health monitor for your home Internet service. By connecting to your existing service, the device gathers data on Internet speed, latency, and reliability without interfering with your service. These data are anonymous and do not contain any information about your personal usage of the Internet.

## Why Get a Speed Tester?

- **Help Improve Internet Connectivity**: By hosting a speed tester, you will contribute directly to efforts of local, state, and federal governments to improve Internet performance for all. Your participation will also assist in identifying network bottlenecks and other issues that make online life a hassle.
- **Better Understand Your Connection**: The speed tester can help you understand your Internet service, empowering you with valuable insights. With a device, you have access to a private dashboard where you can view your performance in real-time.

## Device Hosting Details

- **Minimum Hosting Period**: We request participants to install the speed tester for a minimum of 3 months to collect meaningful data.
- **Compensation**: As a token of appreciation, eligible participants will receive a $50 gift card upon completing the hosting period.
- **Data Privacy**: Rest assured, all data collected from the speed tester is related to your Internet performance. The speed tester will **NOT** collect data on what you do online or how you use the Internet.
- **Publication and Sharing**: The collected data will be published anonymously and shared with our research partners for policy, funding, and research decisions.
